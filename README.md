## A project by Team Rockstar Ninjas
The Shinobi Component Library (SCL) is a collection of meticulously built standard web components for you to use in any web project. Visit our [website](https://ucsd-cse112.github.io/cse112-sp19-team10/) here!  
<img src="docs/img/rockstar_ninja.PNG" title="Team Logo" alt="Team Logo" width="300px"/>

### About Web Components
It can be overwhelming trying to learn everything on web components. We recommend our [short guide](docs/WebComponentGuide.md) and the included "Recommended Resources" section.

## Installation
Each component of our library is encapsulated into one JavaScript file. You can add Shinobi by downloading the [source files](https://github.com/ucsd-cse112/cse112-sp19-team10/releases) (*src.zip*) from the releases page, then adding them to your project.
Alternatively, you can link to the auto-generated CDN link, provided by [jsdelivr](jsdelivr.net).
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/shinobirockstar@1.0.2/src/core_rate.js"></script>
```

If you'd like to [contribute](#contributing) or read the source code, you can:
- Install using `npm install shinobirockstar`  
- Download the zip file from Github
- Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse112/cse112-sp19-team10.git`

Note: 
- If you are using Font-Awesome icons, you need to follow their instructions to include their library in your project. Our library **does not** include Font-Awesome or other external libraries we are using in demos, such as Bootstrap.
- The CDN is auto-generated by jsdelivr from our project on npm, which is currently not auto-updated. Github will always have the most up to date files.

## Getting Started
Each component is named `core-COMPONENT_NAME`, where *COMPONENT_NAME* is the name of the component. Each component comes with default values allowing you to get started using just one simple line of code.

They can be used like so:
```
<core-tooltip>  
        <core-switch></core-switch>  
</core-tooltip>  
<core-rate></core-rate>  
```
Read more on the [Getting Started page](docs/usage/GettingStarted.md).

### API Docs
Component Specific API docs can be found: [here](https://ucsd-cse112.github.io/cse112-sp19-team10/docs/index.html)  
These include a full list of attributes for each component.    

### Examples
There are examples for each component:
- [Rate](https://ucsd-cse112.github.io/cse112-sp19-team10/examples/rate.html)
- [Switch](https://ucsd-cse112.github.io/cse112-sp19-team10/examples/switch.html)
- [Tooltip](https://ucsd-cse112.github.io/cse112-sp19-team10/examples/tooltip.html)

## Contributing
Want to contribute? Read the [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131o201JKLoXA3ThO713b-uAVn71Ql5zLPmLm_eqTdMU/edit) on how to get started!

### Build Environment
Learn how to set up the build environment and use the tools here: [setting up the build pipeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7znBZnsLRjiv7TSTTOygoxcIgXU88AOVcoRg2jSkuY/edit).

### Coding Style
Our project uses the Standard JavaScript Style, (also known as StandardJS), found at [standardjs.com](standardjs.com)  
Read more about our coding style [here](docs/dev/CodingStyle.md).

### Component Architecture
We are using a very straightforward architecture for the components. It should be easy to tell by reading the code. In case you are unsure, read this short explanation [here](docs/dev/Architecture.md).

### Repo Structure
Learn about how our project directories are set up [here](docs/dev/Repo.md).

### Dependencies
Dependencies are listed under `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in the [`package.json`](package.json).  This will have the most up-to-date list.
This is a list of each dependencies:
- mocha: unit tests
- showroom: 
- chai: asserts
- husky: pre-commit tasks using Github hooks
- standard: linter
- testcafe: browser testing framework
- testcafe-browser-provider-saucelabs: use testcafe with saucelabs

### Updating the README
The README is using a [shell script](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) to generate the table of contents. Since the README is not often updated, this script must be manually run to update the table of contents, but they can also be edited manually.  
To run the script, follow the directions to set up the script then run:
```
./utils/gh-md-toc --insert README.md
```

## Testing
- For unit tests, we are using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Showroom](https://github.com/eavichay/showroom). Read about how to modify existing tests and write new ones in our [unit testing guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lbslRDDltuQ9W85m4ydCMiX7PHPhnL075Dgzt4M1Nuo/edit).  
- Browser tests are done through [Testcafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) and [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/). Find our guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x6_YWZVBgTehy1oi4eblvHlfXKKR_XMpY9cHYgYD3EI/edit).
- See our [full list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJwUiCW6A7htAkYt5D9KlLrRf-20Q_cx8ipcCyGnmQ0/edit?usp=sharing) for all the tests for each component

## Known Issues
- Browser tests on TestCafe/SauceLabs sometimes time out, usually with a **ETIMEOUT** or similor error. This causes Travis builds to fail and blocks pull requests on Github. Rerunning the build on Travis generally fixes this issue.
- We are using Showroom, Mocha, and Chai for our unit testing. Unfortunately, this does not integrate well with CodeClimate's test coverage reporter. However, rest assured as we many have unit and browser tests and are confidently it covers a majority of cases.

### Change Log
This project is set up to use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work) to generate a change log from the git commit messages. Please follow the format as outline in their [docs](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work). However, it has not been fully tested or integrated to the master branch. You can read our implementation notes [here](https://drive.google.com/a/ucsd.edu/file/d/1U0ZaXYs-A14-t2VXM4h5-GqYuRQV9C5d/view?usp=sharing).
