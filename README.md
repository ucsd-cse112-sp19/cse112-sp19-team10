## Installation
You can install Shinobi in two ways:  
- Install using `npm install shinobirockstar`  
- Download the zip file

## Getting Started
Each component is named `core-COMPONENT_NAME`, where *COMPONENT_NAME* is the name of the component. Each component comes with default values allowing you to get started using just one simple line of code. 

They can be used like so:
```
<core-tooltip>  
        <core-switch></core-switch>  
</core-tooltip>  
<core-rate></core-rate>  
```
